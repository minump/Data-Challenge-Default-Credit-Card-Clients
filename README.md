# Data-Challenge-Default-Credit-Card-Clients
Data Challenge to find insights and predict the likelihood of default 
This data challenge is aimed at finding actionable insights from the data and predicting the likelihood of default of customers.
### The Task
Task 1 : Build a model to predict the likelihood of default, a model which can generalize to other data points. <br>
Task 2: Envision ways these predictions might be used in the company's product. <br>
Task 3 : There can be a few of the columns in the dataset, some commonly occurring values lack definitions in the documentation;  Try out different methods to deal with this incompleteness of information.
<br>

Main goal : Classification model to classify good customers(who do not default) vs bad customers(who default) <br>
The column to be predicted is 'default payment next month'. <br>
